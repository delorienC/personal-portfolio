# John Doe Portfolio

This is my simple one-page portfolio project built with [Laravel (PHP framework)], PHP 8.4, [TailwindCSS (CSS framework)], **Tailwind-SVG** (icon support), and [GSAP (animation library)]. Iâ€™ve added Docker configuration files in a `devcontainer` folder for a containerized development setup. I will create more example pages in the future for training purposes.

## Features
- Minimal one-page layout  
- Smooth animations with GSAP  
- Docker-based development environment  

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.4  
- Composer (PHP package manager)  
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)  
- Docker & Docker Compose  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run `composer install` and `npm install`.  
3. Edit the `.env` file (e.g., database credentials).  
4. Start containers with `docker-compose up -d`.  
5. Go to `http://localhost/portfolio` in your browser.
